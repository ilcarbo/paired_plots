# CREATE VIOLIN PLOTS FOR PAIRED POINTS EXPERIMENTS

- This notebook let's you create graphs fort experiments with paired points
- You can show the distribution for each group with a violin plot or simply show the points
- The graph includes the median, 25th and 75th quantiles for each group

The resulting graphs are like this:
